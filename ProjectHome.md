Watch TV is kind of not social enough for now. During watch TV, you can only discuss the TV program around you, maybe just your families and close friends.

If you wanna publish your comments or opinion, the way to do so for now, with television (broadcast) station's support, is send SMS to a certain SP or give a phone call to the television (broadcast) station. And this is a one-way-communication.
